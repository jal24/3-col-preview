## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working on this exercise I made an effort to change up how I accomplish certain things, for example a lot of times I'll use a percentage value when setting the dimensions of an element, but for this exercise I decided to go with a rem value instead which ended up giving a better final result in my opinion. I also tried to do a better job with my organization, specifically with the styles, by using more comments and grouping relevant styles together.

### Continued development

This was a great small exercise for me to work on the organization of my code, as well as getting some more experience working with SASS. In the future I'll continue working on writing clean, organized and readable code that is also potentially reusable.
